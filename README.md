# The DMG (GB) Programming Tutorial
The DMG (Dot Matrix Game) (aka GameBoy) programming tutorial features implementations of various things on the original GameBoy for instruction's sake.

Assembly is written for the [RGBDS toolchain](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds) (v0.3.3). ROMs are tested in [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/) (v 1.5.5) running through [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu) on Ubuntu 16.04.
